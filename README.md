# Whereabouts

*More time with friends, less time planning*

Sometimes, you just want some company while you eat lunch or work on your laptop at a cafe.

Avoid the hassle of figuring out which of your friends are both free and closeby. Whereabouts will tell you exactly who's around to hang out, so you never miss an opportunity to meet up.

Whereabouts allows you to:

* Make **events** to let your friends know where you are, and how long you'll be there
* See **other events near you**, using automatic detection of your current location
* Leave a **custom message** on your event, to let people know what you're doing there and what kind of company you want (e.g. study buddy, friend date for coffee, etc.)
* Get **route directions** to every event location
* Use **location autocomplete** to easily select any landmark on the Google Maps API
* Control **privacy**, to invite the general public to join you or just your friends
